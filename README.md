# KANBAN - CMUSV Billboard

An application i'm writing as part of my craftsmanship apprenticeship in Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley. I'm planning to write a Billboard like application that will allow easy and quick sharing of information with students, faculty etc.

While I had an initial idea for this project, it gained momentum in the [Unconference 2013 session](http://whiteboard.sv.cmu.edu/pages/gathering_january_2013_session_summaries) we had over at CMUSV.

[My primary aim](http://journal.kaush.co/software-craftsmanship.html) is to learn TDD, so it is my hope that this application will have a great suite of tests.
